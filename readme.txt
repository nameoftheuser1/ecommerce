This project, E-commerce website named WoodMart is created by BSIT college student, for our subject information management. This website AIMS to do the CRUD or Create Retrive Update & Delete in my Phpmyadmin (database) using PHP as language. This is a first time I try to use PHP sp there might be a code that are hard to understand. Most of the codes here are just got from a tutorial.

I used Bootstrap for a responsive design of this project because I don't want to spend all of my time designing this website.

software used : XAMP & Visual Studio Code for IDE
The flaws of this website is the design and the security, since these factors are required more practice to understand how it work. And I don't have enough time to spend for that.
